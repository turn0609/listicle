# Key Markdown Takeaways

Going into week 2 of learning Markdown, I am starting to understand the many similarities between HTML and Markdown. Both are markup languages, so they will have some similarities in regards to the look of the code as well as the coding process itself. In this Listicle I want to highlight some of the main key features of Markdown and HTML.

## Lists

Making lists in Markdown is easier than in HTML. Markdown lists simply work like a list on any word processor, and you don't have to worry about end tags messing with the final code.
Instead of having to type <.ol> ...content... <./ol>, I can simply just type the numbers
1. content
2. content
3. content
and have the list automatically made for me. I can do the same with
- dahes
* and asterisks
and come up with a similar result.

## Quotes

Quotes are also very easy in Markdown. Inline quotes look much less cluttered than in HTML. Instead of typing <.blockquote> content content <./blockquote>, I can simply use greater-than symbols.
> I am McLovin!

> Technically, I don't have a first name.
GitHub's highlighting of block quotes also adds a nice touch and distinction from regular quotes. Only the best Superbad quotes should be highlighted!

## Inline Code

Inline code is also made easy with Markdown. I am taking both this course and Intro to Computer Science at the same time, so being able to see how different coding languages work has been insightful. By adding a code fence, I can show you how to do the previous Superbad interaction.
```
last_name = str(input("What is your last name? "))
first_name = str(input("What is your first name? ")
print(f"I am {last_name}. {first_name} {last_name}!")
```

In general, while there is more freedom with HTML, the terminal gets pretty cluttered pretty quickly. HTML's requirements of having both an opening tag and a closing tag make for code that can be hard to read, especially when you get to longer blocks of text and websites that have a lot of elements. I can now see the potential usage for keeping docs in code format to then use for HTML text. 

Both HTML and Markdown let you see how your changes are impacting the document live (or nearly live). A simple refresh of the website or switching to the preview tab on GitHub makes it so that seeing your document as it's being written is easy. This is especially convenient if you are like me and want to make sure the formatting looks correct every so often.

Overall, there are advantages to both HTML and Markdown. HTML offers more functions and commands, while Markdown can be effective for simple writing projects that require a little bit of formatting here and there. Knowing both will be essential in my career as someone who hopes to work in the technology field someday. Using Markdown will be especially helpful with online documentation writing that I hope to partake in creating one day,
