# Pros and Cons of Using Docs as Code

My first week in this course has introduced me to Markdown, which is a form of writing that I was previously unfamiliar with.
I had no idea that markdown was essentially just plain text in a different format.
It still feels a bit foreign to type out regular text into a code editor, especially since I have used editors to code with HTML and Python.
Using markdown has many advantages and disadvantages over using a traditional word processor like Google Docs or MS Word. In this listicle, I will go over some of the pros and cons of using Markdown in GitHub over a traditional word processor. 

## Pro: Detailed updates about document changes.

In comparison to MS Word's feature Track Changes, I much prefer GitHub version history. Track changes is often good for small sentence level editing changes, but when it comes to larger document-wide changes the feature is lacking. Being able to see the added and removed content in the document as well as having easy access to version history makes seeing changes much easier. I find that going through and restoring a version of a previous Git commit is less of a hastle than restoring a previous version of an MS Word document. Docs as code +1!

## Pro: Ease of collaboration.

Just to avoid harping on MS Word too much, I'll make the next comparison with google docs. When working on a team, making changes to a single google document becomes hard to manage. Even though it was not discussed in class, I have a little experience with pull requests from a previous course. I have found that sharing multiple versions of an edited document and commiting the best one is more efficient than having 4 different people editing the same document simultaneously. Using pull requests and then merging versions together just makes the most sense to me. And the best part is, all the changes are labeled with who made them! No endlessly searching through the (almost unusable) version history of Google Docs to find who made a change. Docs as code +1!

## Con: Simplicity/cleanliness of formatting.

Although docs as code has a lot of benefits, I recognize one if it's drawbacks as the monotone and cramped style of the code editor. If I were to create a one page instructional guide that had special formatting and images, it would be much easier to use a tradional word processor. Just typing out this listicle is giving me a bit of a headache, as when writing in Google Docs for example I like to use multiple colors and make the font size a bit easier on my eyes. Special formatting is also easier to visualize in Word or Docs, as I don't have to use a bunch of asterisks when **bolding** or *italicizing* things. There is just a cleanliness to the design of Docs and Word that is also very pleasing to the eye compared to a boring code editor. Traditional word processors +1!


The final score is 2 for docs as code and 1 for traditional word processors! Being introducted to the Markdown language will be very helpful in my future as a technical writer. As I want to work both with design and TWC, I will also likely be using GitHub a lot. It will be interesting to see how Technical Writers use Markdown in their everyday work, and if there is a more visually appealing code editor than GitHub's! I look forward to next week and continuing to learn more digital technologies.
